his software is somewhat of a mystery to me. Apparently it works on the Motorola 4500x and 4800x transportable ("bag") phones. It seems to be of U.K. origin.  Some modifications need to be made to the phone: (This is the original image that came with CellTrak, don't blame me if you can't make sense of it) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;only works in ms-dos>>>>>>>>>>
